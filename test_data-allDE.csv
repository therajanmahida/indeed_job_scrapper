"Come help us build the Carta LLC Experience

We're looking for talented engineers to join our team in the Limited Liability Companies (LLC) business unit.

The Company You'll Join

At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they've managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

To learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series F.

The Team You'll Work With

We are a diverse team of 10 individuals with big goals. We want to build a 2 million dollar business in 2020 and scale it to $20 million by the end of 2021. The scope and impact of each individual are immense. We are biased toward action and believe in the mantra of build -> measure -> learn.

On the team, you'll collaborate closely with our product manager and designer to understand the motivation (why) behind a customer want, defining the scope of work (what), and build a solution (how) with your engineering peers to deliver the desired customer value.

Our team is diverse in multiple axes: gender, nationality, technical specialization, and other quirks â€” this our strength. In such an environment, trust and humility are of utmost importance.

Our development philosophy closely mirrors Agile Scrum, but we are not afraid to deviate from it. We care about solving customer problems first and engineering problems second.

The Problems You'll Solve

As we expand beyond Venture Capital, we'll need you to help define requirements and build solutions for products that bridge the gap for clients in Private Equity backed LLCs. We are building a brand new product to address this market.

Here are some problems we need you to help us solve:

LLCs are creatures of contracts, how do we model this variability in Carta?
LLCs are used to represent many different types of asset classes, how are these nuances represented in the data model and how do they cascade into distinct product experiences?
Private Equity firms, their investors, the lawyers, and their portfolio companies have many user personas and access controls. How do we offer great experiences to each of these users?

As one of the first few engineers on this team, you will play a key role in building the initial data model and features for the foundational product. This is a collaborative effort across teams and disciplines. The choices we make will define our future product infrastructure. The cross-functional team is talking to top Private Equity firms and large enterprise customers to gather requirements for our roadmap. In this role you will:

Architecture, design and coding of highly available, secure, and scalable financial platforms
Test-driven development (TDD), high levels of code coverage and automation
Peer code review
Logging and monitoring of platforms for proactive assurance of availability and performance
Measuring results of system changes through metrics, both in speed and in business value
Be a mentor to junior developers
About You

You have strong technical skills, are excited by ""zero to one"" projects, and enjoy working closely with stakeholders across engineering, product business and marketing. You have a desire to become a product domain expert and the ability to refine ambiguous product requirements to deliver customer value. You see communication as one of your strengths.

You have 3+ years of full-stack or backend engineering experience, and experience architecting complex SaaS products with Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and microservices. You have industry experience developing scalable production quality backend systems. You have experience mentoring junior developers.

We use Java (primary) and Python (secondary) to build backend services, and React in the frontend. Java expertise is required. Prior experience in FinTech and all other technologies is ideal, but not required. Our team consists of people who are happy to help you learn everything you need to be successful at Carta.

We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing a positive interview experience for every candidate. If accommodations due to a disability or medical condition are needed, connect with us via email at recruiting@carta.com. As a company, we value fairness, helpfulness, transparency, leadership and build our teams around these values. Check out our careers page to get to know us better as you think about your next step at Carta."

Today, a self-driving car can meander through a country road at night and find its way. An AI-powered robot can learn motor skills through trial and error. This is truly an extraordinary time â€” the era of AI has begun. Image recognition and speech recognition â€” GPU Deep Learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human creativity, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films.
Now, NVIDIA's GPU runs Deep Learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human creativity and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and artificial intelligence come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why NVIDIA GPUs are used broadly for Deep Learning, and NVIDIA is increasingly known as â€œthe AI computing company.â€

"Position Overview:

Sutter Health Design & Innovation is hiring a senior software engineer to break the patterns of our broken healthcare system.
ABOUT THE JOB
You'll be building and delivering features at a fast pace, working on greenfield projects. Youâ€™ll make healthcare more human, not less, with tech that is powerful, yet coy. This is an opportunity to work for social good and make a contribution to programs that raise the health status of the communities we live in.
As part of the Design & Innovation team, you can expect to grow in your strengths, alongside an inclusive, eager team whoâ€™ll support you every step of the way. You will work with a diverse team that includes business leaders, software engineers, data scientists, designers, researchers, and product managers to create useful and elegant solutions.
ABOUT US
Sutter Health is one of the nation's largest not-for-profit healthcare systems, serving 3 million patients across 25 hospitals and hundreds of outpatient facilities in Northern California. The Design & Innovation team moves fast, and has the feel of a small startup within a large organization. We are perpetually curious about people, and that empathy fuels our work.
Ambitious and speedy (by design), we are a build-first island within a buy-first culture. We are creating a portfolio of software projects, with the intent to graduate the best ideas and abandon unsuccessful experiments. Here are some real examples of our recent work to familiarize yourself with what the job entails:
Web-based interface for care teams to collaboratively manage SMS conversations with patients.
Automated, SMS-based surveys to onboard patients and track their health progress.
Remote monitoring dashboard of sleep data for health coaches to support patients form good sleep habits.
Our tech stack is, for now, Ruby on Rails, Stimulus.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Heroku, Twilio, Auth0.
ABOUT YOU (AND US TOO)
You are a generalist, lifelong learner and you love it. You embrace ambiguity, with an ownerâ€™s mentality to decision making. You tilt toward action, threading the needle between analysis-paralysis and urgency. Your M.O. is pattern matching, and youâ€™re always vigilant for perfect storm moments that breakthrough all the roadblocks. And by default, you laugh loud and often.
We want you to contribute uniquely and foster increasing heterogeneity within the team. We know that diversity of experiences, talents and identities create the strongest teams, and weâ€™re ready for the continuous commitment required to build such an inclusive environment.
We might not always agree but we always value each otherâ€™s opinion. Everyone deserves to be heard, and in the end it is not about winning, it is about challenging each other, weighing the pros and cons of each solution and committing to do good work in the best interest of our users, both patients and providers alike.
We are a healthcare company first. That means we honor our personal health first and are committed to creating a workplace that supports a sustainable, healthy work/life balance. You can expect smiles and laughs and celebrations of success and kudos. You can expect a normal 40 hour work week. You can expect 8 hours of sleep. You are not joining a â€˜work hard, play hardâ€™ team. Ours is a â€˜work smart, create awesome thingsâ€™ culture.
We are a remote-work team, but we strive to replicate the camaraderie and serendipitous moments that in-person teams naturally enjoy. Therefore, we all commit to working a daily 4-hour overlap. Outside of that, you choose the start and stop times that make you the most productive and effective colleague.

Qualifications:

QUALIFICATIONS Bachelorâ€™s degree in EE/CE/CS or equivalent education 6+ years of experience as a software engineer Familiarity with human-centered design

"Associate Civil EngineerMC Engineering is a civil engineering firm specializing in water and wastewater planning, design, and construction. MC Engineering is seeking a qualified registered California PE to assist in projects throughout the State. MC Engineering was established in 2012 and has consistently grown itâ€™s client base, consisting primarily of water and wastewater utilities, by providing dedicated service for a variety of projects. MC Engineering offers specialized expertise in smart metering, pipelines, pump stations, water and wastewater treatment facilities.We are seeking a qualified professional to join out team in our office based in Orangevale CA. Preferred expertise will include proposal preparation, planning studies, design, and construction management for related projects. The ideal candidate will have a minimum of 5 to 10 years of experience in the water/wastewater industry and will be capable of mentoring and directing younger engineers, draftsman, and field personnel. Ideally, the selected candidate will be able to assume these responsibilities while growing into an equity position with the company. We offer a 401K plan with employer matching, medical benefits, paid vacation, annual bonuses based on performance, and an opportunity to participate and play a lead role in a variety of interesting projects.The MC Engineering website is currently down for maintenance. Please browse the services outline below for a description of the services offered by our company.MC Engineering Services Overview Construction Management Our team typically stays involved in projects from conception to completion by assisting our clients with field services including on- site inspection, design services during construction, and related coordination of specialty consultants including electrical, structural, and geotechnical engineers. Projects are managed using a collaborative approach that shares available data while relying on proven tools for managing submittals, tracking costs, and documenting critical day to day operations during construction in a professional manner. We have managed projects ranging in costs from $1 million to approximately $10 million, including pipelines, pump stations, treatment facility upgrades, and AMI projects.GIS and Mapping Our team relies on the latest technology for creating state-of-the-art maps, planning documents and design tools that rely on GIS and related asset data. Water system features, collection systems, meters, and other critical facilities can be brought into GIS using our specialized GPS data collectors combined with field survey equipment and the latest ESRI tools. Our mapping often forms the foundation of new asset management programs and related capital improvement programs based on related condition assessments and ranking to establish priority projects.MC Engineering leverages the power of GIS to spatially organize record drawings. Our standard procedure includes creating a record- drawing database that can be easily accessed on any smartphone, tablet, or computer. This database consists of clickable polygons that represent the area covered by plans. Each polygon links to scanned record drawing PDFs.MC Engineering also utilizes GIS to create online asset maps that can be accessed by both field and office staff. MC Engineering has worked to formulate a standard mapping procedure that is catered directly to small to medium sized utilities. We aim to simplify and streamline required software costs and limit the complexity of workflows and data interfaces.Financing Our team has a proven track record of identifying and securing grant funding and low interest loans for qualified projects. We have also been instrumental in establishing and managing assessment districts and related funding programs as well as facilitating bond sales and other viable funding mechanisms for public and quasi-public water and wastewater utilities. The ability to apply for and secure favorable financing is supported by developing effective planning programs, asset management plans, and related documents in advance coupled with an understanding of how amortized costs will affect the long-term rates of customers over time. In addition to our prior experience with other companies and public agencies, in recent years our team has secured close to $20 million in 100% grant funding and low interest loans for our recent clients.Efficiency Our experience provides clients with unique insights into how to improve the efficiency of existing water and wastewater utility operations. We approach water systems from both a top down and bottom up perspective by first analyzing high level performance metrics, often started with a validated AWWA water audit, and then concentrating on the detailed aspects of efficiency as it relates to field assets. The primary considerations from a water efficiency perspective include minimizing water losses while increasing revenues by locating leaks, replacing aging mains and analyzing existing meters to verify accuracy. Our team has played a key role in several AMI and meter projects that ultimately improve operational efficiency by reducing labor costs for reading meters while providing tools to optimize water deliveries. We are trained energy auditors and can quickly analyze existing pumps, motors, and electrical equipment to generate significant savings in electricity costs for both water and wastewater facilities.Infrastructure Design MC Engineering focuses on water and wastewater utility infrastructure including pump stations, pipelines, collection systems and treatment facilities. Good designs are generally the byproduct of effective planning that takes into consideration the on-going O&M costs for these critical facilities that often play a fundamental role in the quality of life for the communities we serve. Our designs are complimented by a skilled team that is well versed in GIS, CAD drafting, and modeling tools.Planning and Studies Good projects start with effective planning aimed at analyzing existing systems and developing recommendations that make the best use of existing limited capital. Our team has prepared water master plans and preliminary engineering reports that evaluate the entire water utility and focus on short- and long-term projects that meet our clients operational goals with consideration of available resources and capital. With aging systems it is critical to approach system wide improvements by ranking and prioritizing the most critical needs. We have applied this philosophy to both water distribution networks and sewage collection system while taking into consideration the cost of leaks and inflow and infiltration, respectively. Our planning documents are typically used as a firm basis of securing funding for related projects, much of which has been in the form of low interest loans and grants.Water Audit Validation SB 555 now requires all medium and large water utilities to submit a validated AWWA water audit annually for inclusion in a state-wide database. MC Engineering staff are certified to validate the required reporting data and we provide related follow-up services aimed at reducing non-revenue water including meter testing, leak detection, smart metering, and related technologies as part of our efficiency services.MC Engineering typically provides the following to document the results of the Level 1 Validation:1. Updated version of the completed AWWA water audit software2. Documentation required for submittal to the State Department of Water Resources3. A list of potential improvements to the District's water loss management and data collection practices including a technical memorandum detailing the results of the water audit validationJob Type: Full-timePay: $0.00 per hourExperience:Water/Wastewater Design: 5 years (Required)License:California Civil PE (Required)Working Days:Monday (Required)Tuesday (Required)Wednesday (Required)Friday (Required)Thursday (Required)Additional Compensation:BonusesOther formsBenefits:Paid time offThis Job Is Ideal for Someone Who Is:Dependable -- more reliable than spontaneousPeople-oriented -- enjoys interacting with people and working on group projectsAchievement-oriented -- enjoys taking on challenges, even if they might failAutonomous/Independent -- enjoys working with little directionInnovative -- prefers working in unconventional ways or on tasks that require creativitySchedule:Monday to Friday8 hour shiftCompany's website:www.mc-engineers.comBenefit Conditions:Waiting period may applyOnly full-time employees eligibleWork Remotely:Yes, temporarily due to COVID-19"
