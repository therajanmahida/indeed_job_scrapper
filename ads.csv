"Overview:

Do you have a background in computational research and love to write code? Do you want to help enable and advance groundbreaking computational social science research? If so, Princeton University's Research Computing department is recruiting a Research Software Engineer to join the fast growing Research Software Engineering (RSE) Group.

In the RSE Group, we collectively provide computational research expertise to multiple divisions within the University. As a central team of software experts, we are focused on improving the quality, performance, and sustainability of Princeton’s computational research software. Our group is committed to building collaborative environments in which the best software engineering practices are valued, and to sharing and applying cross-disciplinary computational techniques in new and emerging areas.

In this position, you will be an integral member of multiple research teams focused on cutting-edge social science research and machine learning. You will join teams of researchers associated with the Data Driven Social Science Initiative (DDSSI) and the Center for the Study of Democratic Politics (CSDP) to develop efficient and scalable research code by providing computational expertise in software development, algorithm selection, and optimization.

If you have a strong background in scientific programming or high performance computing, academic research, and an interest in contributing to computational social science you have the right skill set to make an immediate impact on multiple high-profile research projects. You will be poised to grow and expand your programming and data analytics expertise into a dynamic new set of research problems.

This position will require you to work closely with colleagues in the Office of Information Technology (OIT) as well as with faculty, student/postdoctoral researchers, and technical staff to enable and accelerate their research computing efforts.
